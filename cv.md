  # For the vCard you can either provide a link to a .vcf file in assets (see `pdf` above),
  # or use `h2vx.com` to generate a vCard on the fly based on the structured data of the resume page.
  # The later requires `hydejack.no_structured_data: false` and only works once the site is deployed to a public URL.
